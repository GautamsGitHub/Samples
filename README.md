# Samples
Some of my programs as a sample of my abilities.
Feel free ask me for more samples.

**Original Python Game**
python game_playing.py to start.
Control a character moving around a colosseum dodging tomatos from the crowd.
Top down view of the scene.
Controls are customizable. The Windows default control uses arrow keys for movement, and Esc to pause.
There are also a couple of cheat codes to help the developer top the leaderboard.
All other keys diplay an image on the screen in case the users wants to appear as though they are working.
The game can also be saved and loaded again. Python pickle is used to save the game state.
The game was developed before I had a good grasp of object oriented programming.

**Clustering**
Implements k-means clustering

**SQL Example Registration**
Checks the POST, if the first name field is empty, a form is generated and shown.
If the first name field is set, the results from the form are inserted into the SQL database.
If the email address is already used by another record in the database, the user is asked to enter a different email address.

**Countries Quiz**
Requires a key from rapi-api. Put the key where it says <KEY GOES HERE>.
cURLs data regarding countries and their capitals from rapid-api.
Searches the response for countries for which a capital is available and adds the pair of country and capital to an array.
A country and its capital is randomly selected and some capitals that do not match the country.
Set of buttons is generated for each answer. The button with the correct answer allows the user to move onto a new question.
